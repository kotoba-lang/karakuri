(ns karakuri.methods.export
  "karakuri (絡繰) T3 structured-export — the data-portability / anti-lock-in leg (G9).

  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/export.py`.

  The structural inverse of vendor lock-in: pull the MEMBER's OWN data out of a service into a
  portable kotoba-native form (or push it into another service). Two G9 invariants are enforced
  by construction: the export owner is always the member (no third-party PII), and the export is
  always encrypted (an encrypted-envelope ref per com.etzhayyim.encrypted.*, ADR-2605181100 —
  the artifact carries a CID/ref, never plaintext). Live fetch is G6-gated; R0 produces an
  export PLAN only.

  ExportArtifact is a plain map with the Python dataclass field names as kebab keywords. Pure
  clojure.core; portable .cljc."
