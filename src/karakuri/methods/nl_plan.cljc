(ns karakuri.methods.nl-plan
  "karakuri (絡繰) NL→ServiceOp planner — Murakumo-only (ADR-2606039200, G4).

  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/nl_plan.py`.

  Turns a member's natural-language brief into an ordered list of normalized ServiceOps (each
  gated by command/plan), Charter-Rider scanned (N6), as a dry-run plan (G6). The canonical NL
  parser is the Murakumo LLM (LiteLLM 127.0.0.1:4000, gemma3:4b — G4); a deterministic heuristic
  is the always-available, hermetic fallback. The live LLM call is a refused-by-default membrane
  (operator + flag gated), so this module is offline-safe and never reaches the network at R0.

  G4 Murakumo-only · G5 mutate-gated · G6 dry-run only · N6 Charter-Rider scan.

  CommandPlan is a plain map with the Python dataclass field names as kebab keywords. The live
  env read is behind #?(:clj …). clojure.core + clojure.string only; portable .cljc."
