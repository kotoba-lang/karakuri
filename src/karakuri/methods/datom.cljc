(ns karakuri.methods.datom
  "karakuri (絡繰) kotoba Datom audit projector — every ServiceOp is a Datom (G7).

  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/datom.py`.

  Projects a planned (or, post-activation, executed) ServiceOp / CommandPlan / ExportArtifact
  into kotoba EAVT entity maps that mirror kotoba/schema.edn (and seed.edn shape), and assembles
  a `kg.ingest_batch` body. This is the G7 audit trail: as-of, replayable, 非終末論 — a member can
  audit exactly what touched their account. Two safety rules:

    - G3 no-secret-leak: only flag KEYS are serialized into :op/args (never values, which could
      carry a token); the encrypted session-grant lives elsewhere as an encref, never here.
    - G6 dry-run: :op/dry-run is True at R0; live ingest into kotoba is operator-gated (refused).

  `planned-at` is supplied by the caller (a runtime stamps it; tests pass a fixed value) — this
  module performs no clock reads, so its output is deterministic.

  Entities are string-keyed maps keyed by ':ns/name' strings (kept verbatim, the seed.edn
  spelling). sha-256 + the live env read are behind #?(:clj …). Self-contained sha-256 (no
  sibling provides it). clojure.core only; portable .cljc."
