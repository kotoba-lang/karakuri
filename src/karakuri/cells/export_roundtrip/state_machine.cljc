(ns karakuri.cells.export-roundtrip.state-machine
  "Phase state machine for the karakuri export_roundtrip (絡繰) cell.
  1:1 Clojure port of cells/export_roundtrip/state_machine.py (ADR-2606039200 / ADR-2606160842).

  Graph: owner-check -> format-select -> export-plan. Wires the T3 export builder (methods/export)
  into the manifest graph. G9 own-data-only + encrypted (enforced by construction), G6 dry-run (live
  pull/push gated), G7 audit-ready output.

  Conventions: the dataclass ExportState → a plain map with the SAME string field keys the Python
  `cs.__dict__` round-trips; phase enum values stay strings; the export artifact keeps the kebab
  keyword keys produced by methods/export; OwnerViolation is the {:type :owner-violation} ex-info."
