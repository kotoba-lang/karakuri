(ns karakuri.cells.session-broker.state-machine
  "Phase state machine for the karakuri session_broker (絡繰) cell.
  1:1 Clojure port of cells/session_broker/state_machine.py (ADR-2606039200 / ADR-2606160842).

  The defining karakuri skill: broker access to the MEMBER's OWN service session WITHOUT the platform
  ever holding secret material, allow read ops freely, and route every mutating op to a member
  signature. The gates are pure, unit-tested transitions; the cell's .solve() raises until Council
  activation.

  Invariants enforced:
    G1 — member-principal / own-account-only: the principal AND the account owner are the member;
         a third-party account is refused.
    G3 — no-server-key: the grant carries serverHeldKey=false and an encrypted-envelope REFERENCE
         only (never plaintext credentials); a server signature is refused (ADR-2605231525).
    G5 — read-default / mutate-gated: :read ops are allowed at R0; any :create/:update/:delete op
         awaits a member signature before it can be authorized.

  Conventions: the dataclass BrokerState → a plain map with the SAME string field keys the Python
  `cs.__dict__` round-trips; phase enum values stay strings; ValueError → ex-info."
